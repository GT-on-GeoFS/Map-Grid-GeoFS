# Map-Grid-GeoFS
Adds a route on your navigation for you to see where you are going using Simbreif 

**First off, I'd like to say This extention was not made by me, it was made by TKE587, all credit goes to him for making and developing the map grid extention**

**Secondly, this map extention is only compatible with SimBrief Coordinates. No other Coordinate type will work**

<ins>How to add it to GeoFS?</ins>
1. Download, click on the (zip) folder, and you should find a .js file
2. Drag the .js file into a new tampermonkey user script (web browser extention) 
3. Save it and Open GeoFS
A "ROUTE" tab should be next to your "TALK" button

<ins>How to use the Map Grid Extention?</ins>
1. Make your route in Simbrief (https://www.simbrief.com/home/)

2. Generate the flight plan

3. Once Generated, scroll down to the OFP section

4. Scroll down the OFP to the Flight Log (or untill you find Waypoint names and Coordinates)

5a. Copy and paste Coordinates into Square Brackets With a comma after every waypoint

5b. For example, This is a direct (straight line) route from Vancouver to Amsterdam - [N4911.7,W12311.0],[N5218.5,E00445.9]

6. Once the route is made, Open up GeoFS (Making sure your Navigation bar is open), and Click the "ROUTE" button

7. Pate your route in the box that will pop up and you should see a route on your navigation bar

8a. If there is an error in the route, the pop up shall tell you that is faulty and for you to recheck for any errors. 

8b. For example here is an faulty route with the 13th waypoint (theres no comma after the 13th waypoint)
